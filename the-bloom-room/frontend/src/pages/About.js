            <h2>Why This Solution Was Built</h2>
            <p>
              ArtConnect was built to give artists a dedicated space where their
              work is seen, valued, and connected with the right audience. It was
              created by a university student at Open Window to address the gap
              between talent and opportunity in the modern art world. Every
              feature was designed to be simple, intuitive, and focused on fostering
              creativity and collaboration.
